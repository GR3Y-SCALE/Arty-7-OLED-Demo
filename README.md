# Arty-7-OLED-Demo
VHDL in Vivado that displays text on the digilent PMOD OLED screen. This project is primarily written in VHDL with Verilog used for simulation.
This is to be opened in Vivado and currently displays an idle animation on physical hardware, with simulation also working.

## TODO
SPI implementation needs to be debugged so characers display to the screen.
